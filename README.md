### Concept of App
* Problem - Organizing multiple musical artists and bands over several months
* Solution - create an app that organized artists, venues and associated gigs
* Floe - Inspired by Fyre, a booking app for venues to book artists
* MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
    * Target Market: Band Managers
    * Managing MULTIPLE bands and artists



### How it works!

![Demo](https://github.com/LianaSun/GroupProject2/blob/master/public/assets/img/demo.gif)

Input your artist names. Input your venue options. Create gigs for that artist and note the venue. Floe will automatically organize the gigs by date.  You can view your artist's gigs or view the upcoming gigs for that venue. Need an exact address? Click on the venue name with the listed gigs to view the exact location and address with the API's, Foursquare and HERE. 

With Floe, you're given the controls to edit and delete artists, venues and gigs.

### Motivation
* Inspired by FYRE
* Organize the bands/artists/events/venues in one place
* Give the manager a calendar overview to see where all
bands/artists will be
* Save that information so itâ€™s easily accessible to the
manager and the artist
